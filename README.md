# Homework overview
+ the goal of this homework is to provide a strategy to the following game : you play a game where a word is randomly chosen from a dictionary of 10-letter words, and you then try to guess what that word is. Every time you give a guess, you
are told how many characters are in common between your guess and the chosen word. The payout of the game starts at 10. If the guess is not right then the payout of the game is reduced by 1; game ends if it reaches zero or if your strategy guessed the right word.
